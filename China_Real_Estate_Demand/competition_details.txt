Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated using a custom two-stage metric based on the absolute percentage error between predicted and actual values. The custom score is computed from a scaled MAPE with two stages.

First stage:

If over 30% of the submitted samples have absolute percentage errors exceeding 100%, a score of 0 is immediately given.

score = 0  if  (1/n) * Σ_{i=1}^n  I{ (|y_i^pred - y_i^true| / y_i^true) > 1 }  > 0.3

Second stage:

Otherwise, an MAPE is calculated with the samples that have absolute percentage errors less than or equal to 1. Then the MAPE is divided by the fraction of absolute percentage errors less than or equal to 1. Finally, the score is 1 minus the scaled MAPE.

D = { |y_i^pred - y_i^true| / y_i^true  s.t.  |y_i^pred - y_i^true| ≤ y_i^true }

score = 1 - average(D) / (|D| / n)

where |D| is the magnitude of D.

Submission File
The submission file must contain exactly these two columns: id and new_house_transaction_amount. Each id is formatted as a month in the form of %Y %b and a sector id in the form of sector n joined by an underscore. For each id in the test set, you must predict the total new house transaction amount in ten thousand Chinese Yuan for the specific month and sector. The total new house transaction amount is equal to total new house transaction area times transaction price per area. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,new_house_transaction_amount
2024 Aug_sector 1,49921.00868
2024 Aug_sector 2,92356.22985
2024 Aug_sector 3,480269.7819
etc.
Submission Requirements
Preserve row order: Maintain the exact same row order as in test.csv
Exact Columns: The submission file should contain the exact columns as in test.csv

You must notify Kaggle promptly upon discovering any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.
2.5. WINNER LICENSE
a. Under Section 2.9 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

Non-Exclusive: You hereby grant and will grant to Competition Sponsor and its designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission, in any media now known or developed in the future, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without further approval by or payment to you.

For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.

In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.9, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.

2.6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.9 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):

Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.

By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)

Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
2.7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.

2.8. PRIVATE CODE SHARING
a. Private Code Sharing. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”). This prohibition includes sharing Competition Code between separate Teams, unless a Team merger occurs. Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.

b. Public Code Sharing. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.

c. Use of Open Source. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

2.9. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligation(s):

Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment.
